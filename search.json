    "text": "1 Data preparation\n\n1.1 Baseline demographics\nParticipants’ self-reported demographic information including age (in years, computed from the participant’s birth date and the questionnaire completion date), gender (female, male), and race (White/Caucasian, Black/African American) was collected via a baseline questionnaire administered via REDCap.\n\n\n\n1.2 Baseline quality of life\nTo assess quality of life, participants also completed the PROMIS Profile 29+2 v2.1 (Cella et al., 2019) as part of the baseline questionnaire. T-scores (centered at 50) were obtained from participants’ item-level responses via HealthMeasures Scoring Service using the default calibration sample. T-scores were obtained for the following domains: ability to participate in social roles/activities, anxiety/fear, cognitive function, depression/sadness, fatigue, pain interference, physical function, and sleep disturbance.\n\n\n\n1.3 Daily surveys\nDaily goodness ratings (indicated using a 5-point Likert scale in response to the question, “How would you describe today?”) and endorsements for up to 31 activities were obtained using an in-house questionnaire administered electronically via Qualtrics. There were n=244 diary survey responses from n=21 unique participant IDs (including responses for the following 2 missing/invalid IDs: 0, NA) in the data exported from Qualtrics on February 23, 2024. There were no responses for the following 2 expected participant IDs: 13, 14.\nWe performed the following initial steps to clean the daily diary data:\n\nDrop responses that were less than 50% complete (n=0/244, 0.0%)\n\nDrop responses with missing or invalid participant IDs (n=21/244, 8.61%)\n\nAssign surveys to a date using a time threshold of 0 minutes after midnight; i.e., any survey completed between 12:00 AM and 11:59 PM on a given date is treated as corresponding to that date\n\nDrop responses recorded before the participant’s study start date and after the participant’s study end date (n=23/223, 10.31%)\nDrop duplicate responses recorded by the same participant on a given date by retaining only the latest completed survey (i.e., the survey associated with the max timestamp) with a non-missing value for the day’s overall goodness rating (n=22/200, 11.0%)\nFill missing values for binary activity endorsements with 0, on the assumption that a lack of endorsement reflects that the participant did not engage in the activity\n\nThis left us with a total of n=178 diary survey responses from n=18 participants (mean (SD) responses per participant, 9.89 (3.82); range, 1-15) eligible for analysis. All responses for participant ID 1 were dropped.\n\nAll analyses were performed in Python v3.12.2."

To compute ICC, we fit an intercept-only linear mixed effects model with daily goodness rating as the outcome and random intercepts for participant. We extracted the estimates of the random effects (i.e., between-group, where the groups are the participants) and residual (i.e., within-group) variance. ICC was then calculated as the ratio of the between-group variance and the total variance (the sum of the between-group and within-group variances).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN observations\nN groups\nBetween-group variance\nWithin-group variance\nICC\n\n\n\n\n178\n18\n0.12\n0.3935\n0.2337\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\nThe ICC for daily goodness rating was 0.2337; i.e., 23.37% of the total variance in goodness rating was accounted for by participant grouping. If ICC is relatively small, this suggests that goodness rating has more “state” variability, or relatively small differences between persons and relatively large differences within persons. If ICC is relatively large, this suggests that goodness rating has more “trait” variability, or relatively large differences between persons and relatively small differences within persons.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Activities\n\n2.3.1 Across participants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\nN=178\n\n\nn\n%\n\n\n\n\nEat a meal\n160\n89.89\n\n\nMessage others via text or email\n133\n74.72\n\n\nWatch TV\n131\n73.6\n\n\nSpend time in person with others\n124\n69.66\n\n\nTaking a shower\n118\n66.29\n\n\nUse social media\n98\n55.06\n\n\nNap or rest\n95\n53.37\n\n\nSocialize with others via phone or video\n90\n50.56\n\n\nPrayer or spirituality\n87\n48.88\n\n\nEngage in leisure activities or hobbies\n81\n45.51\n\n\nSurf the web\n76\n42.7\n\n\nDo household chores or home maintenance\n73\n41.01\n\n\nCook or prepare a meal\n73\n41.01\n\n\nListen to music\n70\n39.33\n\n\nManage physical symptoms\n56\n31.46\n\n\nSpent time with a pet\n50\n28.09\n\n\nExercise or play sports\n46\n25.84\n\n\nSpend time in nature\n40\n22.47\n\n\nHandle financial matters\n37\n20.79\n\n\nRead a book\n36\n20.22\n\n\nWork at a job\n36\n20.22\n\n\nCare for or help another person\n35\n19.66\n\n\nAttend medical appointments\n26\n14.61\n\n\nMeditation\n23\n12.92\n\n\nPlay video games\n16\n8.99\n\n\nParticipate in a club or religious group\n10\n5.62\n\n\nCare for or help the community\n4\n2.25\n\n\nAttend an educational event\n2\n1.12\n\n\nParticipate in therapy or counseling\n1\n0.56\n\n\nEngage in sexual activity\n1\n0.56\n\n\nParticipate in a support group\n0\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Within participants"

    "text": "3 Associations with goodness ratings\n\n3.1 Participant-level goodness and baseline measures\nTo characterize the association between participants’ mean goodness rating and age in years at enrollment and PROMIS t-scores for each of the available domains at baseline, we calculated a series of Pearson correlations. To characterize the association between participants’ mean goodness rating and gender (female, male) and race (Black/African American, White/Caucasian), we performed a series of independent samples t-tests. We corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) (q-value).

To ensure sufficient variability for analysis, we analyzed only those activities that were endorsed on between 20.0% and 80.0% of all surveys.

We analyzed only participants who had at least n=2 observations and non-zero variance in goodness, and within each participant, only those activities that had non-zero variance in endorsement. We corrected for multiple comparisons for each participant by controlling the false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg procedure). Point-biserial correlation coefficients were calculated using the scipy package (v1.11.3) and p-value adjustment was performed using the pingouin package (v0.5.4).\nThe figure below displays the results of the analysis as a heat map. Activities (n=30) are displayed along the y-axis and participants (n=17) are displayed along the x-axis. The association between daily goodness rating and a given activity for a given participant (point-biserial correlation coefficient) is displayed along the color axis, with darker reds indicating stronger negative and darker blues indicating stronger positive correlations; grey squares indicate that there was zero variance in the endorsement of a given activity for a given participant, precluding calculation of the respective correlation coefficient."
